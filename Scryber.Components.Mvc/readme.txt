Scryber is an advanced PDF generation tool that allows
complete definition of a dynamic PDF document based
on HTML, code, cascading stylesheets,
databinding and templates in referenced files.

This framework is built entirely in .NET and is
open source under the LGPL licence so you can link to
it in commercial applications.

Scryber.Core
-------------

For GUI or Console applications, use the base Scryber.Core
package so the web based references are not needed.

Always happy to get contributions, suggestions, and definitly bugs.
If there's something you want it to do, then - I'd hope scryber can be made to do it.
