    <description>The scryber pdf engine for dotnet 6 - Beautiful documents from templates made easy.

Scryber is an advanced PDF generation engine based around HTML templates with CSS styles and SVG drawing. It includes full flowing pages, dynamic template binding on your object model and referenced external files, images, css and fonts. Easily create documents from your Apps, MVC sites, or Javascipt ajax calls.

This framework is built entirely in .NET6 supporting Blazor and is released under the LGPL licence so you can use to it in commercial applications.</description>
