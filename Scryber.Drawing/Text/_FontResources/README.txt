At scryber we own a license for these fonts.

They are included in this solution as embedded resources,
so text strings using the standard pdf fonts can be measured for widths etc.

They will not be embedded within the output as readers should use thier versions of the standard fonts.

If you don't own a license for them, please don't use them outside of this solution or anywhere else.

Thanks, the scryber team
